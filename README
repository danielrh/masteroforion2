Master of Orion 2 Galaxy Balancer

In Master of Orion 2, the galaxy generation is random. In recent experiments we have found that even the 3rd system colonized can have up to a 20% effect on the final score. This kind of imbalance can cause extremely unfair games that can last up to 20 hours.

The solution is to balance the galaxy so that everyone has an equal opportunity to grow their empire with the same planets.

The basic design is to pick a half, quadrant (or 1/6th) of the galaxy depending on the number of players and reflect it across the mirror lines.  Then everyone will experience the same first few planets and can adjust appropriately.


Usage Example:

star_edit SAVE1.GAM SAVE2.GAM q0 SAVE3.GAM

The above example takes the planets from SAVE1.GAM applies it to the monsters and 4 player races and planet picks of SAVE2.GAM takes the 0th quadrant (numbered from 0 to 3) and saves the result into SAVE3.GAM

        Generic usage star_edit <planetInput> <raceInput> <quadrantSelection> <output>

        The general usage is that <planetInput> should be set to a Master of Orion II save game file, often the same file, that contains the planets and <raceInput> should be set to the save game that has the desired races. Then the quadrantSelection selects a portion of the map and rotates and mirrors it so that every player gets an even shake. <output> should be set to the final save file that may be reloaded for the fair game

        quadrant selection is limited to the following options:

        2 player options:
        h0 assume a 2 player game and take the left half and reflect it
        h1 assume a 2 player game and take the right half and reflect it
        v0 assume a 2 player game and take the top half and reflect it
        v1 assume a 2 player game and take the bottom half and reflect it

        4 player options:
        q0 assume a 4 player game and take the top left quarter and mirror it
        q1 assume a 4 player game and take the bottom left quarter and mirror it
        q2 assume a 4 player game and take the bottom right quarter and mirror it
        q3 assume a 4 player game and take the top right quarter and mirror it

        6 player options:
        x0 or x1 or x2 or x3 or x4 or x5 mirror the appropriate slice
